Data:
- The 'mpg.csv' data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.
- The 'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv' data is a telelcom dataset where you have to predict whether the customer is going to churn (leave the telecom company) or not. This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

Analysis:
- Developed a linear regression model that explains 81.6% of the variability of the response data around its mean using the 'mpg.csv' data. Explored the dependency of miles-per-gallon on various features of the car and the extent of it. Finally, used the model to predict mpg values for sample values of vehicle features.
- Built a logistic regression (with around 80% accuracy) to predict the 'Churn' variable based on client features using the 'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv' data. Additionally, identified variable that influences the churn of clients and thier level of significance. Finally found the clients with highest chance of leaving.
